# About Me
Bjs is short for "半卷书".<br>

I am a senior programmer with over 10 years of experience, currently serving as an software architect and team leader. I have extensive expertise in PHP and Golang development and have gained valuable practical experience in both programming languages.

Throughout my career, I have organized and built multiple project management tools that have played a critical role in enhancing team collaboration and project delivery efficiency. I have successfully led teams to complete over 10 innovative projects, demonstrating my strong project management and team leadership skills.

I prioritize teamwork and effective communication, and I excel in collaborating with cross-functional teams. I have a proven track record of working collaboratively with team members from diverse backgrounds and skill sets, driving project success collectively. I possess strong problem-solving skills and thrive in high-pressure environments while maintaining excellent performance.
