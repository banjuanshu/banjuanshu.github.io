Today, I find myself with a million tasks to do. Last week I was away, and the work piled up…

On one hand, it’s kind of depressing to think that the rest of my life is filled with work. Filled with various tasks I need to complete every day, that in the grand scheme, are mostly pointless.

95% of the things I did today will amount to nothing. Will be forgotten in 5 years. The project will fail, wither out, I’ll lose interest, or I’ll find a better way to do the thing.

But that is kind of the beauty of it all. There is no *end*.

And if there was an *end*, I know I would only feel temporary finality, and probably go start working on something new, and the work would start all over.

Lately I’ve been enjoying the process of doing my small, pointless tasks. Instead of feeling burdened by them, I feel empowered by them. They give my purpose.

I work hard to do them to the best of my ability. I’m not focused on just getting them done, but doing them well, with care and passion.

Sure, there are truly pointless tasks you shouldn’t do at all. And you should outsource things to save you time. But there will always be more work after that. And that’s a good thing.

The work never ends. So enjoy the work, learn to love the work. Get addicted to the daily work. Focus on the process, not the outcome.

工作永无止境，所以学会热爱工作，享受工作，沉迷于工作吧，否则人生就太痛苦了。
